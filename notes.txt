### here are some notes i am taking on nov 11 / 2022 about voice cloning as I go.
Voice cloning 
large amounts of high quality recordings is impractical for many speakers 

Goal transfer learning 
key idea of transfer learning 
    transfer knowledge from one task with a lot of labelled data
    to related tasks with very little labelled data
        text to speech
        zero shot setting 
            transfer to voices unessen in the training set 

Approach: Voice Cloing 
    Decouble speaker modeling from speech synthesis 
    speaker-discriminate embedding network 
    text to speech network 
        conditioned on embedding unique to speaker
